            <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by {siteName} ("we"). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use
                our websites and online services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.
                We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we may, in some cases, provide you with notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you
                a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and
                the ways you can help protect your privacy.
            </p>

            <h3>Collection of Information</h3>

            <p>
                Information you provide to us. We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features
                of the Services, fill out a form, make a payment, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address,
                payment method information and any other information you choose to provide.
            </p>

            <p>
                Information we collect automatically. When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:

                <ul>
                    <li>Log Information: We collect log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you
                        visited before navigating to our Services.</li>
                    <li>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, local storage and web beacons. Cookies
                        are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular
                        and count visits. Local Storage similarly enables our Services to store data (like login tokens) securely in your browser and unlike cookies, it's not sent to the server on every
                        request. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For more
                        information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below.</li>

            </p>
            <p>
                Information we collect from other sources. We may also obtain information from other sources. For example, if you connect your account with an account you have with a third-party service (such as GitHub),
                we will have access to certain information from that service, such as your profile information, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service. Additionally, we may collect information
                about you from third-party sources that help us to learn more about you, like for example your profile picture or social media handles.
